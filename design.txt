Note: This is just for me to keep track of what is going on and isn't necessary for the final project.

bitboard.cpp: Contains a helper class for working with bitboards.

board.cpp: Contains a class where everything related to board state belongs.

move.cpp: Contains the definition for a "move" 🤩. In chess  engines ♟️, a move is defined as a "half-move" 🤨, describing only what one colors plays 😁.

movegen.cpp: Contains a class to generate all possible legal moves given a "Board" instance.

constants.cpp: Contains useful constants.

Origin Square: is the square occupied by a piece about to move
Target Square: is the square occupied by the moving piece after making the move
